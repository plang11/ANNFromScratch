## Additional Information

The code is currently set to run through 3000 iterations. Depending on your computer, this may take a significant amount of time. You may choose to set the number of iterations to a much smaller amount while you are playing around with it. 

For more hands on learning, try adding an additional hidden layer to the NN, or trying giving it different data for a different problem and tweaking it so it works.

For any questions with the code, please reach out to me at patricklang96 (at) gmail . com. 

**Enjoy!**
